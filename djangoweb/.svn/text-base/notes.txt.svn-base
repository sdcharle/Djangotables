Django table editor:

Stats Aug 22

All basic functionality OK, add, edit, delete.

Weird or annoying things:

if you add a field that's an empty string it shows as 'Click To Edit'
Weird javascript err if you do add to table (datatables func) as part of add
hiding the ID field causes things to get whacked.
If you edit on a page other than the first, it jumps back to a previous page

To add:
Show err message in red instead of alert for failed add
Add button instead of 'click to add'
Delete button that shows up to right (left?) of selected row

Nice to have
More parametrized/easily mod'ed stuff (can swap in other data models easily)
nice colors, etc
